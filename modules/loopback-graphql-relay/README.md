# Relay GraphQL Server for Loopback

Combine the powers of GraphQL with the backend of Loopback to automatically generate GraphQL endpoints based on Loopback Schema.

## Installation

```sh
npm i loopback-graphql-server -S
```
Add the loopback-graphql-server component to the `server/component-config.json`:

```
"loopback-graphql-server": {
  "path": "/graphql",
  "graphiqlPath": "/graphiql",
  "subscriptionServer": {
    "disable": true,
    "port": 5000,
    "options": {},
    "socketOptions": {}
  },
  "modelMutationGroups": false,
  "modelQueryGroups": true
}
```

Requests will be posted to `path` path. (Default: `/graphql`);

Graphiql is available on `graphiqlPath` path. (Default: `/graphiql`);

GraphQL subscription Server can be customised by passing `subscriptionServer` configuration. More information can be found at (https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws#subscriptionserver) or (https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/subscriptions.html)

## Inspiration
This repository originally started as a fork of the [loopback-graphql](https://github.com/Tallyb/loopback-graphql) project by [Tallyb](https://github.com/Tallyb) and the [loopback-graphql-relay](https://github.com/BlueEastCode/loopback-graphql-relay) by [BlueEastCode](https://github.com/BlueEastCode). I have fixed many bugs and tested on enterprise environment. This version is ready for production use.
